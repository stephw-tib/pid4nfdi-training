What is a PID?
==============

A PID (Persistent Identifier) is a long-lasting reference that provides unique identification of research resources, persons, institutions, projects, devices and many more. Unlike regular URLs, 
which can break or change, PIDs are designed to be stable over time, 
ensuring consistent access to the associated content.
