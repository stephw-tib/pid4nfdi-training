PID - Persistent Identifier
=======

What is a PID?
-------------
A PID is a **long-lasting reference to a (digital) object**, such as a document, dataset, or resource. 
Unlike regular URLs, which can break or change, PIDs are designed to be stable over time, ensuring consistent access 
to the associated content. Examples of PIDs include DOIs (Digital Object Identifiers) for academic papers and datasets, 
and ORCID iDs for researchers and other contributors.
