Getting started with PIDs - PID4NFDI Cookbook
===================================

This is a **cookbook** to support you in getting started with PID registration and usage. 
It provides information on ...

**What is a PID?**
A PID (Persistent Identifier) is a long-lasting reference to a digital object, 
such as a document, dataset, or resource. Unlike regular URLs, 
which can break or change, PIDs are designed to be stable over time, 
ensuring consistent access to the associated content.


**Lumache** (/lu'make/) is a Python library for cooks and food lovers
that creates recipes mixing random ingredients.
It pulls data from the `Open Food Facts database <https://world.openfoodfacts.org/>`_
and offers a *simple* and *intuitive* API.

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.
