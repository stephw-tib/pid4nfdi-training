Getting started with PIDs - PID4NFDI Cookbook
===================================

This is a **cookbook** to support you in getting started with PID registration and usage. 
It offers practical guidance on first steps for individuals and organiziations looking to implement PIDs in their workflows. It provides an introduction to what PIDs are, their importance in ensuring long-term access and citation of digital resources, and how they help in maintaining research data, publications, and other digital assets. 

The cookbook is an initiative of the `PID4NFDI project <https://pid.services.base4nfdi.de/>`_ to set up a basic service for Persistent Identifiers (PID) for the member consortia of the German `National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) <https://www.nfdi.de/?lang=en>`_ - a joint project of research and infrastructure institutions to optimise research data management within the German research landscape.

**What is a PID?**
A PID (Persistent Identifier) is a long-lasting reference to a digital object, 
such as a document, dataset, or resource. Unlike regular URLs, 
which can break or change, PIDs are designed to be stable over time, 
ensuring consistent access to the associated content.
