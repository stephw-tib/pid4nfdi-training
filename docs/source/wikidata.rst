Wikidata ID
====================

What is Wikidata ID?
--------------------

The Wikidata ID is a unique identifier assigned to each entity in Wikidata, a free and collaborative knowledge base. These identifiers, which begin with a "Q" followed by a number (e.g., Q42 for `Douglas Adams <https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q42>`), allow for precise referencing of concepts, people, places, and more across various datasets and systems. Wikidata IDs facilitate linking and integrating structured data, enabling interoperability and accessibility across multiple platforms and applications.

Wikidata IDs differ from many other Persistent Identifiers in that they identify entities in a collaboratively curated knowledge graph rather than registered digital objects. Their persistence is ensured through community governance and editorial practices, not through formal service guarantees or registration contracts.

Wikidata ID vs. Wikidata IRI
While the short identifier (e.g. Q42) is commonly used in user interfaces, the canonical machine-actionable form is the Wikidata IRI (https://www.wikidata.org/entity/Q42). This IRI is resolvable, globally unique, and suitable for use in Linked Data and semantic web contexts.

Typical use cases
-----------------

* Linking persons, organisations, places, or concepts across datasets
* Enriching metadata via links to external identifiers (ORCID, ROR, GND, DOI)
* Acting as a hub identifier in metadata graphs

When should you use Wikidata IDs?
---------------------------------

Use Wikidata IDs when:
* You need a shared, community-maintained identifier for a concept or entity
* You want to link across multiple identifier systems
* You work with semantic web or knowledge graph technologies

Do not rely on Wikidata IDs when:
* You need contractual persistence guarantees
* You need to cite or register research outputs
* Governance, versioning, or provenance must be institutionally controlled


How to create a new Wikidata item?
----------------------------------

Check for Duplicates: Before creating a new item, search using the "item by title" tool to ensure it doesn’t already exist. Enter the Wikimedia site language code (e.g., "en" for English) and the exact page title to locate existing items.
  
* Create the Item: If no item exists, click "Create a new Item" in the left menu or use the link at the bottom of an unsuccessful search.
* Provide Basic Details: Add a label and description for the new item. Optionally, include sitelinks to related Wikimedia pages.
* Save: Click "Create" to finalize the new item. You can edit and expand its details later.
* This streamlined process helps maintain an organized and comprehensive knowledge base.

Relation to other PID systems
-----------------------------

Wikidata IDs are typically used alongside other PID systems. A single Wikidata item may reference ORCID iDs for persons, ROR IDs for organisations, DOIs for publications, or IGSNs for samples, thereby acting as an integration layer rather than a replacement.
