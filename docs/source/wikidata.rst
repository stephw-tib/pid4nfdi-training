Wikidata ID
====================

What is Wikidata ID?
--------------------


The Wikidata ID is a unique identifier assigned to each entity in Wikidata, a free and collaborative knowledge base. These identifiers, which begin with a "Q" followed by a number (e.g., Q42 for Douglas Adams), allow for precise referencing of concepts, people, places, and more across various datasets and systems. Wikidata IDs facilitate linking and integrating structured data, enabling interoperability and accessibility across multiple platforms and applications.

How to create a new Wikidata item?
----------------------------------

Check for Duplicates: Before creating a new item, search using the "item by title" tool to ensure it doesnâ€™t already exist. Enter the Wikimedia site language code (e.g., "en" for English) and the exact page title to locate existing items.
  
* Create the Item: If no item exists, click "Create a new Item" in the left menu or use the link at the bottom of an unsuccessful search.
* Provide Basic Details: Add a label and description for the new item. Optionally, include sitelinks to related Wikimedia pages.
* Save: Click "Create" to finalize the new item. You can edit and expand its details later.
* This streamlined process helps maintain an organized and comprehensive knowledge base.
