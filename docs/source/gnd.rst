GND - Gemeinsame Normdatei
==========================

What is the GND-ID?
-------------------

The GND-ID (Gemeinsame Normdatei Identifier) is a globally unique and persistent identifier used to unambiguously reference entities such as persons, organizations, works, and subjects in the Gemeinsame Normdatei (GND). Managed by the German National Library (Deutsche Nationalbibliothek, DNB), it is an essential tool for ensuring consistency and interoperability in cataloging and metadata management.

The GND is widely used in libraries, archives, and museums as well as in research projects that require standardized references to entities. The GND-ID links these entities across systems, facilitating seamless data exchange and enhancing findability and reusability.

What is the main purpose of the PID service?
--------------------------------------------

The GND-ID serves several key purposes:

* **Disambiguation**: Ensures that entities with similar or identical names are uniquely identified.

* **Standardization**: Promotes consistent metadata across systems, improving interoperability.

* **Interconnection**: Facilitates linking between resources by providing a stable reference for each entity.

* **Cultural Heritage and Research**: Supports the integration of data in libraries, archives, and research projects by creating persistent links to authoritative records.


What are the prerequisites to use the service?
----------------------------------------------

To use GND-IDs, organizations or individuals typically need to:

* Be Part of an Authorized Community: GND-IDs are primarily assigned and managed by institutions that are part of the GND network, such as libraries, archives, and museums.
* Have Access to the GND System: This often requires collaboration with the German National Library or other authorized partners.
* Understand GND Data Standards: Adhering to the GND's metadata and cataloging rules is crucial for contributing to or utilizing the system effectively.

How to get started?
-------------------

Here’s a basic guide to getting started with GND-IDs:

* Learn About the GND: Start by exploring the `GND website <https://gnd.network/Webs/gnd/DE/UeberGND/ueberGND_node.html>`_ provided by the German National Library. This site offers detailed information about the GND system, its structure, and its use cases.

* Check Eligibility: Determine whether your organization is eligible to register or request GND-IDs. This usually involves being part of the library, archive, or research community.

* Contact the German National Library: For organizations, reaching out to the DNB or an authorized GND partner institution is the first step to gaining access to the system. Individuals can often collaborate with these organizations for their needs.

* Register or Obtain an ID: IDs are usually created within the framework of cataloging activities. If you need to reference an entity that doesn’t already have a GND-ID, an authorized GND partner can help you create one.

* Integrate into Workflows: Once you have access, you can use GND-IDs in your metadata systems to ensure consistent references and enable linked data applications.

Do any FAQs exist?
------------------

Yes! The German National Library provides a `FAQ section <https://gnd.network/Webs/gnd/DE/UeberGND/FAQ/faq_node.html>`_ covering common questions about the GND system, its usage, and its integration into workflows.

What costs are charged for use?
-------------------------------

The use of GND-IDs is generally free of charge. However, contributing to or directly accessing GND services may involve collaboration agreements with the German National Library or its partners, which might come with administrative or operational costs depending on the scope of your participation.
