ORCID - Open Researcher and Contributor iD
#####

What is ORCID?
----------------

The ORCID (Open Researcher and Contributor iD) is an ID for researchers that offers numerous advantages to you and your research institutions:

It simplifies tasks for researchers, such as maintaining their publication lists. Anyone contributing to the scientific research process can use their ORCID iD to uniquely link their publications, research data, and other outputs of the research process (e.g., research software). This ensures that these outputs are visible and reliably connected to their creators.

In addition, the ORCID iD enables researchers to connect with funding bodies, universities, research communities, publishers, and repositories. Automated personal identification helps your institution gather information on researchers' scientific output from external sources, aggregate research information (e.g., in a research information system), and manage publications internally more efficiently.
