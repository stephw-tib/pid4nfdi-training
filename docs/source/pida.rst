PIDA - Persistent Identifiers for Semantic Artifacts
====================================================

Overview
--------

PIDA is a service developed and offered by the Helmholtz Metadata Collaboration, designed to provide unique and persistent URLs (PURLs) for digital assets. These URLs ensure long-term accessibility and discoverability for both human users and automated systems.

The service includes features such as content negotiation, making it particularly useful for managing and referencing digital resources like ontologies.
