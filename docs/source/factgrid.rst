FactGrid - A database for historians
====================================================

What is FactGrid? What is special about the service?
----------------------------------------------------

`FactGrid <https://database.factgrid.de/wiki/Hauptseite>`_ is a specialized Wikibase platform tailored for academic research, leveraging software initially developed for Wikimedia's Wikidata project. It enables researchers to manage and interlink data with flexibility beyond traditional relational databases. Users can define and customize objects ("items") and their properties, facilitating diverse and complex data structures.

The platform is designed for multilingual collaboration, allowing users from various linguistic backgrounds to work on shared objects, each described in their respective languages.

Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) on FactGrid
--------------------------------------------

Every database object on FactGrid is assigned a unique Persistent Identifier (PID). Labels and properties are used to define these items, ensuring that the data is accessible and meaningful in multiple languages. Properties are systematically cataloged under ascending P-numbers, forming the basis for structured statements.

FactGrid aims to address the problem of fragmented data repositories by interlinking information across projects. For instance, only one entry for "Paris" (Q10441) exists as the capital of France, avoiding redundancies. Its identifiers are integrated with other databases, enabling reciprocal linking for enhanced object identification.

Project Participation and Requirements
-----------------------------------------------------

FactGrid welcomes research projects to contribute data under the CC0 license. While data is freely available for download, adding or editing content requires a registered account, typically set up by a project’s principal investigator. Projects must outline their research goals but are otherwise free to create and explore items without notability restrictions.

Getting Started
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
New items on FactGrid are automatically assigned QIDs when created manually or imported via batch processes. To avoid duplicates, users can employ tools like OpenRefine or spreadsheet functions (e.g., VLOOKUP) to match data against existing entries. Initial setup often includes consultations, such as video calls, to discuss data integration and platform use.

Costs and Funding
---------------------------

FactGrid’s services are free of charge. The platform has been supported through various funding sources, including Germany's National Research Data Initiative (NFDI), with a five-year grant of €20,000 annually starting in 2023. This funding supports the development of tools for the database, while individual projects may fund additional features for their specific needs.

Common User Questions
--------------------------------------------------------

Most questions are practical:

  * How should we prepare spreadsheets for input?
  * Which FactGrid properties should we use for the best integration?
  * Which new properties do we need?
  * How do we match place names in our data with the over 300,000 places already available on FactGrid?
  * Where can we find specific datasets to feed into FactGrid, now that we realize we shouldn't duplicate existing data from other sources?
  * How do we communicate on the platform?
  * How long will it take us to create a set of 1,000 people? (Only a few minutes, once you identified the overlaps with already existing information.)

Where can I find information to start working on the platform?
