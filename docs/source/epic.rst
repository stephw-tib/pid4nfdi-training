ePIC - European Persistent Identifier Consortium
===========================

What is ePIC?
-------------

The ePIC (Persistent Identifier Consortium for eResearch) identifier is a globally unique, persistent identifier designed for long-term management and referencing of digital and physical resources. Developed by the ePIC consortium, it ensures that data, samples, publications, or other research outputs remain accessible and citable over time. The system supports robust metadata and flexible resolution services, making it a versatile tool for managing research assets in a reliable and interoperable manner. The PIDs created and maintained are based on the Handle System.

How do I get an ePIC?
---------------------

To obtain an ePIC identifier, you need to work with a registered ePIC service provider, which is typically a member of the ePIC Consortium. Here’s a step-by-step guide:

1. **Find a Service Provider**: Identify an organization within the ePIC Consortium that offers PID (Persistent Identifier) services. Many are universities, research institutions, data centers, or National Research & Education Networks (NREN).

2. **Register as a Client**: Contact the provider to register and set up access to their PID services. The client will usually be provided with a dedicated namespace/prefix. The prefix is allocated in the top level namespace 21. Based on the policy of ePIC the Client will get access to the APIs for the management of PID and their metadata.

3. **Provide Metadata**: Submit the necessary metadata for the resource you want to identify. The specific requirements will depend on the service provider and the type of resource. The metadata attributes of the PID can be standardize by using the typing service https://typeregistry.lab.pidconsortium.net/

4. **Obtain the Identifier**: Once your metadata is submitted, the service provider will issue a unique ePIC identifier.

5. **Use and Manage the Identifier**: Integrate the ePIC into your workflows for citation, sharing, and resource management. Updates or additional metadata can often be added as needed.

* explore the ePIC Consortium website (https://www.pidconsortium.net/) for additional information and a list of participating providers.. 

* start with the `FAQ section <https://www.pidconsortium.net/?page_id=1060>`_. 

* The API documentation can be found here: https://doc.pidconsortium.eu/docs/. 

* To get support for the selection of metadata or the typing of metadata attributes, please contact: support@pidconsortium.net. 

Interoperability
----------------

The ePIC system is fully interoperable with DOI (Digital Object Identifier) standards. Any ePIC identifier, including its prefix, can also be resolved using the Global Handle Resolver, ensuring seamless integration into existing research infrastructures.
