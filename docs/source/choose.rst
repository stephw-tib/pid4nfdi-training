How to choose a PID?
============

Choosing a suitable PID for your specific use case depends on numerous factors. The first step is to clarify which entities require PIDs and for what purpose.

Different PID providers—i.e., services that offer the infrastructure for PID registration (such as DataCite or ORCID)—cater to various use cases. They support different types of entities and offer diverse options for describing these entities through metadata (both machine-readable and/or human-readable). These options are based on varying schemas and standards, differing maintenance requirements, as well as governance and business models that impact persistence and cost structures.

Some identifier systems are more widely used in specific research fields than others. Additionally, existing PID registration practices within an organization, memberships with specific PID providers, or the technical infrastructure already in use can influence the decision to adopt a particular PID system.

A general checklist on choosing a PID system
---------------------------------------------
   * What is the purpose of the resources for which we need PIDs?
   * How many PIDs do we want to register, and for what types of resources?
   * How do we ensure the long-term, persistent availability of these resources?
   * Which organization is hosting the infrastructure?
   * Does the hosting organization or infrastructure service (e.g., library) already register PIDs with a specific provider?
   * Does the technical infrastructure we use already include a PID plugin or integration?
   * What budget is available for the registration and maintenance of PIDs?

Support for PID Selection
-----------------------------
The PID Guide (`pidwijzer <https://www.pidwijzer.nl/>`_), developed by the Dutch Digital Heritage Network, helps organizations and projects choose the right Persistent Identifier (PID). It offers 25 questions across 5 themes to assess PID needs, with answers rated on a scale from “strongly agree” to “strongly disagree.” Based on responses, a list of recommended PIDs is provided.

Additionally, the `PID Guide Toolkit <https://www.pidwijzer.nl/en/pid-guide-methodology>`_ is available under a CC0 license for customization. Users can add PIDs (e.g., ePIC) or adjust the scoring to better fit their requirements. The toolkit includes an HTML page (with JavaScript and CSS) and an English manual.

A PID Selection Guide tailored for the NFDI (National Research Data Infrastructure) is planned for the PID4NFDI integration phase (January 2025-December 2026).
