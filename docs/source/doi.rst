DOI - Digital Object Identifier
=====
What is a DOI?
---------------

A **DOI (Digital Object Identifier)** is a type of :ref:`pid` used to uniquely identify and provide a stable link to digital objects, such as academic papers, research datasets, reports, or other online content.
Key features of a DOI include:
 * **Unique and Persistent:** Each DOI is unique and remains associated with its resource, even if the resource's location (URL) changes.
 * **Resolvable:** DOIs can be entered into the DOI resolver (e.g., https://doi.org/) to redirect users to the current location of the resource.
 * **Widely Used:** DOIs are commonly used in scholarly publishing, ensuring reliable citations and access to academic work.
 * **Format:** A DOI typically follows a format like 10.xxxx/xxxxx, where the prefix identifies the publisher or organization, and the suffix identifies the specific object.
For example, a DOI for a research article may look like https://doi.org/10.1000/xyz123.

DOIs for Researchers and other Contributors

**How can I get a DOI for my publication?**


DOIs are not provided to researchers directly. DOIs for research resources such as publications, datasets, software and other entities will be e.g. registered by a repository provider such as your university library repository, a generic or discipline-specific data repository.
