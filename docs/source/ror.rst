ROR - Research Organization Registry
====================================

**What is a ROR ID?**

ROR is an open registry of research organization identifiers.It helps standardize the identification of institutions in scholarly communications, ensuring accurate attribution and easier data sharing. All ROR IDs and metadata are provided under the Creative Commons CC0. The registry data is openly available via a search interface, REST API, and data dump.

**Structure**

A ROR ID consists of a unique 9-character string appended to the ROR domain. The preferred form of a ROR identifier is the entire URL: `<https://ror.org/04aj4c181>`_ rather than ror.org/04aj4c181 or 04aj4c181, although the ROR API will recognize all three of these forms as ROR IDs.

**Who runs ROR?**
ROR, the Research Organization Registry, is operated as a collaborative initiative by California Digital Library, Crossref, and DataCite, in conjunction with a broad network of community stakeholders.

**How to get / update a ROR?**
The process for registering ROR IDs and managing ROR records differs from the workflows used for ORCID iDs and DOIs. Unlike these systems, ROR IDs are created and maintained through a **centralized curation** process guided by the community.

Anyone can propose additions or updates to the registry, regardless of affiliation. You don't need to be connected to an organization to suggest changes to its record in ROR. There are **no fees** or access requirements for using ROR.
