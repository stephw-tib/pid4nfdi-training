Privacy Statement

Data protection is of high priority for the Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB). As a general rule, the use of TIB’s services does not require the provision of any personal data.

Registration for TIB services
------------------------------

Users may register for services via TIB’s web pages. When registering for and using a service, TIB collects personal data in order to be able to provide such services to users. The services cannot be used without providing the required data.
Which data is collected depends on the service. The legal basis for the collection of such data shall be the Terms of use of the TIB, the Special Conditions applicable to the respective service, or the consent given by the user. For further information, please refer to the information sheets on data protection provided for the respective services offered by the TIB.

**TIB services with registration:**
e.g.
  * `Registration for the local use of the TIB (library card) <https://opac.tib.eu/DB=1/LNG=DU/SID=d19ae0a0-0/LNG=EN/>`_
  * `Registration for the TIB Document Delivery <https://www.tib.eu/en/register>`_
  * `Registration for the use of the TIB AV Portal <https://av.tib.eu/registration>`_
  * `Registration for the use of the oer-recommender <https://learn.edoer.eu/>`_

The TIB processes and stores the data subject’s personal data only for the period of time necessary to achieve the purpose of the storage or for the period of time for which the consent was given and in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation as well as the state and institution-specific data protection rules and regulations applicable to the TIB. Thereafter, the personal data shall routinely be blocked or deleted in accordance with the statutory provisions. If the user no longer wishes to use the services of the TIB and in the absence of any claims of the TIB against the user and of any other legal basis for storage, we shall delete the personal data upon request. Where the user does not use the service for a prolonged period of time, the personal data will be deleted after the expiry of a period separately specified for the respective service.


Subscription to TIB newsletters and newsletter tracking
--------------------------------------------------------

Users can subscribe to newsletters via the TIB web pages in order to receive information on offers and news at regular intervals. This shall require registration providing title, name and email address. Using the double opt-in procedure, a confirmation email shall be sent to the email address first registered by a data subject for the purpose of receiving the newsletter, in order to check whether the owner of the email address has authorised receipt of the newsletter.

When registering for the newsletter, TIB stores the IP address of the computer system used by the data subject at the time of registration, as well as the date and time of the registration. Collection of this data is necessary in order to be able to trace any (possible) misuse of the email address of a data subject at a later date.

The personal data collected during registration for a newsletter are used exclusively for the purpose of sending the newsletter. In addition, subscribers of the newsletter can be informed by email if this is necessary for the operation of the newsletter service, e.g. in the event of changes in content or technical aspects of the newsletter. The personal data collected for sending the newsletter will not be passed on to third parties. Subscription to the TIB newsletter can be terminated by the data subject at any time. Consent to the storage of personal data for sending the newsletter can be withdrawn at any time. For the purpose of withdrawal of consent a link is provided in each newsletter . Furthermore, it is possible to unsubscribe from the newsletter at any time directly on the website of the controller or to inform the controller thereof in any other way.

The TIB newsletters contain so-called tracking pixels. A tracking pixel is a miniature graphic embedded in emails sent in the HTML format to enable log file recording and log file analysis. Based on the embedded tracking pixel, the Technische Informationsbibliothek (TIB) is able to identify if and when an email was opened by a data subject, and which links in the email were clicked.
This information is stored and evaluated by the TIB in order to optimise the distribution and the content of the newsletter. Data subjects may withdraw the declaration of consent given via the double opt-in procedure. Following withdrawal, this personal data will be deleted by the TIB. TIB shall construe any unsubscribing of the newsletter to constitute a withdrawal.


Contact possibility via the web pages
-------------------------------------

The TIB’s web pages contain information and forms that enable quick electronic contacting via contact form or by email providing name and email address also for customers not registered with the TIB. The indication of name and email address is necessary to establish contact following clarification of the data subject’s concerns. The personal data transmitted by the data subject to the TIB via email or via a contact form are automatically stored internally and only for the purpose of processing or contacting the data subject.
