RAiD - Research Activity Identifier
===================================

What is RAiD?
--------------
The `Research Activity Identifier (RAiD) <https://www.raid.org/what-is-raid>`_ system provides persistent identifiers (PIDs) for research projects and other research activities. It also serves as a global registry of such projects/activities. Unlike local project identifiers used by research institutions, RAiDs enable globally unique and machine-readable identification of research activities across different systems as well as long-term referencing across the entire lifecycle of a project. This supports improved tracking, reporting, linking, and sharing of related metadata, inputs, and outputs of a project.

Who provides the RAiD system?
-----------------------------
The system was developed by the `Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) <https://ardc.edu.au/>`_, which acts as the Registration Authority for the RAiD system under the international `ISO 23527:2022 <https://www.iso.org/standard/75931.html>`_.
ARDC is responsible for 
  * Developing and maintaining the RAiD infrastructure and registry.
  * Coordinating with global partners to ensure international adoption and interoperability.
  * Managing RAiD registration services for Australia and New Zealand.

In Europe, `SURF <https://www.surf.nl/en>`_, a provider of digital services for research and education in the Netherlands, is working with ARDC to establish a regional RAiD Registration Agency. SURF will offer its RAiD Service within the Netherlands as well as integrate it into the `European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) <https://eosc.eu/>`_ service portfolio, and it invites organizations to express their interest in collaborating with SURF.

The `Digital Object Identifier (DOI) <https://pid4nfdi-training.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doi.html>`_ Registration Agency `DataCite <https://datacite.org/>`_ and ARDC have established a strategic partnership to deliver RAiD, integrating it into DataCite’s PID ecosystem. This enables RAiDs to be part of the PID Graph, supports scalable and cost-efficient registration, and simplifies integration for organizations already using DataCite services. RAiD Registration Agencies can issue DOIs using DataCite’s infrastructure to submit a core subset of RAiD metadata to DataCite while retaining detailed, project-specific metadata within the RAiD system.
