RAiD - Research Activity Identifier
===================================

What is RAiD?
--------------
The `Research Activity Identifier (RAiD) <https://www.raid.org/what-is-raid>`_ system provides persistent identifiers (PIDs) for research projects and other research activities. It also serves as a global registry of such projects/activities. Unlike local project identifiers used by research institutions, RAiDs enable globally unique and machine-readable identification of research activities across different systems as well as long-term referencing across the entire lifecycle of a project. This supports improved tracking, reporting, linking, and sharing of related metadata, inputs, and outputs of a project.

Who provides the RAiD system?
-----------------------------
The system was developed by the `Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) <https://ardc.edu.au/>`_, which acts as the Registration Authority for the RAiD system under the international `ISO 23527:2022 <https://www.iso.org/standard/75931.html>`_.
ARDC is responsible for 
  * Developing and maintaining the RAiD infrastructure and registry.
  * Coordinating with global partners to ensure international adoption and interoperability.
  * Managing RAiD registration services for Australia and New Zealand.

In Europe, `SURF <https://www.surf.nl/en>`_, a provider of digital services for research and education in the Netherlands, is working with ARDC to establish a regional RAiD Registration Agency. SURF will offer its RAiD Service within the Netherlands as well as integrate it into the `European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) <https://eosc.eu/>`_ service portfolio, and it invites organizations to express their interest in collaborating with SURF.

The `Digital Object Identifier (DOI) <https://pid4nfdi-training.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doi.html>`_ Registration Agency `DataCite <https://datacite.org/>`_ and ARDC have established a strategic partnership to deliver RAiD, integrating it into DataCite’s PID ecosystem. This enables RAiDs to be part of the PID Graph, supports scalable and cost-efficient registration, and simplifies integration for organizations already using DataCite services. RAiD Registration Agencies can issue DOIs using DataCite’s infrastructure to submit a core subset of RAiD metadata to DataCite while retaining detailed, project-specific metadata within the RAiD system.

What is the difference between a RAiD and a DataCite DOI?
----------------------------------------------------------
RAiD is a standard specifically designed to uniquely identify research activities, and to collaboratively collect and publicly share information about them. Its metadata schema is tailored to capture the lifecycle of a project, offering a version history to display changes of (for example) a project’s contributors, funding, outputs, or relations to other projects. In contrast, DataCite DOIs cover a broader scope of potential research activities and outputs with more general metadata requirements.

What is the difference between a RAiD and a grant or award PID?
----------------------------------------------------------------
RAiDs and `grant <https://www.crossref.org/documentation/research-nexus/grants/>`_  or `award <https://support.datacite.org/docs/registering-datacite-dois-for-awards#applying-the-datacite-metadata-properties-to-awards>`_ PIDs serve different purposes in the research ecosystem. A RAiD is minted by those leading a project. It uniquely identifies and captures information about the research activities: how has a project evolved and what has actually been achieved during its duration?  A grant or award PID is registered by a funding agency and refers specifically to a financial instrument that supports research; it identifies the grant or award as a contractual or administrative entity rather than the research activity it funds. While a project may be funded by one or more grants or awards, a RAiD tracks the research endeavor as a whole, independent of the source or number of grants. Linking RAiDs to grant/award PIDs enables clear attribution of funding while preserving a comprehensive view of the research activity.
